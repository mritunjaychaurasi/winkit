					<b>Step 2: Accept Job</b>{" "}
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						When a client logs on with an issue, our system will work to connect
						them with a Geek experienced in that area. If that’s you, you will
						receive an email and a notification on your Geeker dashboard. This
						will give you a description of the issue the customer needs
						assistance with.
					</li>
					<li>
						Click Accept Job so that you can be connected. The system will wait
						for the customer to start the call, so hang tight :-){" "}

				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					<b>Step 3: Wait for the Customer to Connect</b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Give the customer 1-2 minutes to connect to the call. If they do not
						connect, click the Start Call button and it will call the customer’s
						cell phone.
					</li>
					<img src={require("./instructionimages/unnamed (2).png")} width="700px" className="img-fluid" />

					<li>
						Instruct the Customer to click JOIN on their screen in order to join
						the meeting.{" "}

						Audio button on their screen.
					</li>

			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					<b>Step 4: Introduce yourself</b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Once connected, introduce yourself and confirm the issue.</li>
					<li>
						<b>Example :</b>{" "}
						<p>
							Hi (Customer Name), Thanks for connecting with Geeker, my name is
							(Name) and before we begin, I just want to confirm that you need
							help with (explain the issue they listed). Is that correct?. Ok,
							let’s get started.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li></li>

					<img src={require("./instructionimages/unnamed (5).png")} width="700px" className="img-fluid" />

				</ul>

			<div>
				<p>
					<b>Step 5: Summarize the issue on the dashboard</b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Summarize the issue with the client on the dashboard and click Add.
						Please note that the clock will not start until after these details
						are added
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							**It should not take longer than 3 minutes to confirm and verify
							that you can assist a customer with an issue. If you realize that
							this is outside of your scope, please put the customer back in the
							cue (click the Transfer button) so another technician can assist
							them**
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>After you add all of the details, click Submit.</li>

			<div>
				<p>
					<b>Step 6: Resolve the issue</b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						When working with your customer, make sure to address the specific
						issue they are having. Also make sure to ask if they would prefer
						for you to take over their screen or if they would like you to walk
						them through the process.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the customer would like you to take over their screen, they need
						to click Enable Remote on their screen. This has to be started on
						the Customers side. Once they click this, you are good to go.
					</li>
					<li>
						The first time you connect Remote with a Customer, you will have to
						know this. Click HERE.
					</li>
					<img src={require("./instructionimages/unnamed (8).png")} width="700px" className="img-fluid" />

					<p>
						In order to PAUSE a Remote Session, you will need to look at the
						bottom right of the screen to see the bar.
					</p>
					<p>
						IMPORTANT: If you are in the middle a Remote Session and the free 6
						minutes is up for a new customer, you MUST pause the Screen Share
						until they enter their Credit Card info to continue with the
						session.

						If at any point you realize you need to Convert to a Long Call,
						CLICK HERE for instructions on this portion.
					</p>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					<b>Step 7: Ending the Call</b>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Before ending the call, make sure to ask the customer the following
						questions:
						<ul>
							<li>Have I resolved your issue?</li>
							<li>Are you satisfied with the results of this call? </li>
							<li>
								If so, would you be willing to take 30 seconds to give feedback
								in the system once the call ends?
							</li>
							<li>
								The customer will automatically be prompted to give you a
								rating, so encourage them to do so.
							</li>

				<p>
					In order to screen share with a customer, they must initiate that on
					their side. Have them click the Share button on their screen to do
					this.
				</p>
				<p>
					The customer will be prompted to download Zoho. Make sure to let them
					know and tell them it’s a quick download.
