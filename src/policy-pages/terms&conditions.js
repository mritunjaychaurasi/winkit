    software programs and applications (collectively, “Tech Services”). All Tech
    Services through the Platform are provided on a remote basis through
    telephone, inernet or other means of digital communication. Tech Services do
    not presently include hardware repair services. Geeker facilitates
    communication and transactions between Consumers and Service Providers.

    responsible for, any Service Provider’s services or advice. Geeker is not an
    agent of any Service Provider, and Service Providers are not employees or
    agents of Geeker. Geeker does not sponsor, endorse, recommend or approve any
    Service Provider. While we try to confirm that Service Providers meet
    certain requirements, we cannot and do not represent or warrant that any
    Service Provider is licensed, qualified, insured or capable of performing
    any service. We do not make any guarantees, warranties or representations of
    any kind regarding any Service Provider or any services or advice of any
    Service Provider, and we will not be responsible for any action or inaction
    of any Service Provider. Any reference to or use by any Service Provider of
    any aspect of the Platform, or of trademarks or other brands or names of
    Geeker, does not in any way change the disclaimers by Geeker regarding
    Service Providers as described in this paragraph. Reference to any products,
    services or other information by trademark, manufacturer, supplier or
    otherwise does not constitute or imply an endorsement, sponsorship or
    recommendation by us. We do not guarantee that the Platform can match a
    Consumer’s service needs with a Service Provider or that Service Providers
    capable of and willing to meet a Consumer’s service needs will be available
    as and when needed. Any quote or estimate provided in connection with a
    request for Tech Services is only a guide, not a contractually binding
    offer, and is not a guarantee of the actual cost of your specific project.

    sole and absolute discretion, elect to provide a refund or credit toward
    future services. Any payment which Geeker has elected to refund will be

    account, addressing complaints, billing or other account-related matters, or
    other purposes reasonably related to the Services. You agree that automated

    provision of Tech Services or Platform services, or otherwise in connection
    with Tech Services or Platform services (individually and collectively,
    "Collected Information"). You Are Responsible for User Submissions. The
    Platform may permit you and other Consumers and Service Providers to submit
    Information (individually and collectively, "User Submissions"). The person
    submitting a User Submission, and not Geeker, is solely responsible for that
    person’s User Submission and the consequences of submitting it. By way of
    example and not limitation, if a Service Provider provides you with advice
    or other information, the Service Provider (and not Geeker) is solely
    responsible for that advice and information. You acknowledge and agree that
    Geeker has no obligation to pre-screen your or any other person’s User
    Submissions. Knowingly submitting false names or contact information, or not
    keeping your contact information updated, not only wastes everybody’s time,
    it could result in harm to consumers (including violations of privacy) and
    significant legal and regulatory liability, damages, penalties and costs for
    Geeker and our service providers and partners. Accordingly, if you knowingly
    input false information in connection with a service request, including any
    name, telephone number or other contact information that is not yours
    (whether it’s someone else’s or just made up), or if you fail to keep the
    information in your Geeker account current and correct, you agree to fully
    indemnify and be liable to Geeker and each Service Provider or other party
    who accepts that service request for any claims (including claims under the
    Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act or its state law equivalents),
    losses, liabilities, damages (direct, punitive, consequential or other),
    fines, penalties, and costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
    fees) incurred by the affected parties in connection with the false or
    incorrect information. We have the exclusive right to choose counsel, at
    your expense, to defend any such claims. Limited Disclosure of User
    Submissions. You further acknowledge and agree that the description of the
    project for which you request Tech Services, all information contained in
    any reviews of Service Providers that you submit and any photos that you
    upload may be viewed by the general public and will not be treated as
    proprietary or confidential. Please be careful what you post, to avoid
    inadvertently disclosing your address or any other personal information that
    you do not wish to be seen by the general public. License to User
    Submissions. With respect to both User Submissions and Collected
    Information, you grant Geeker a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
    fully paid, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sub-licensable and
    transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works
    of, publish, broadcast, publicly perform and display, make, use, import,
    offer to sell, sell, and otherwise transfer and exploit all copyrights,
    inventions, and other intellectual property rights in the User Submissions
    and Collected Information in any form and any medium, subject to our
    obligations in the Privacy Policy relating to personal information. We will
    not pay you or otherwise compensate you for User Submissions or Collected
    Information. You represent that you are the exclusive owner of all rights in
    the User Submissions that you submit. Do Not Post Illegal, Harmful, or
    Prohibited Content. You agree not to post, submit or link to any User
    Submissions or material that (i) is prohibited under the section above
    entitled Permissible Use/No Objectionable Conduct; (ii) directly or
    indirectly directs persons to another online or offline location that
    provides products or services similar to the Platform services or Tech
    Services; (iii) involves unsolicited or unauthorized advertising,
    promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or
    any other form of solicitation; or (iv) facilitates gambling, gaming,
    raffles, lotteries, sweepstakes, and/or any other activity featuring the
    award of a prize. Reviews of Service Providers. You may only post a review
    of a Service Provider if you have first-hand knowledge of the services
    provided by such Service Provider (that is, such Service Provider provided
    Tech Services to you). You may not accept anything of value from a Service
    Provider in exchange for posting a review. You may not post or submit a
    review of a Service Provider if you are (i) an employee, contractor, partner
    of, or otherwise affiliated with, such Service Provider, (ii) an employee,
    contractor, partner of, or otherwise affiliated with, a competitor of such
    Service Provider, or (iii) related to such Service Provider, including by
    blood, adoption or marriage. You agree that any review that you post or
    submit will be honest and factually accurate. Review of User Submissions. We
    do not approve, control or endorse your or anyone else's User Submissions
    and have no obligation to do so. However, we reserve the right (but assume
    no obligation) to pre-screen, refuse, remove or modify User Submissions for
    any reason, at our sole discretion. Suggestions. If you elect to provide or
    make available to Geeker any suggestions, comments, ideas, improvements or
    other feedback relating to the Platform, Tech Services or otherwise
    (“Suggestions”), Geeker will be free to use, disclose, reproduce, have made,
    modify, license, transfer and otherwise utilize and distribute your
    Suggestions in any manner, without credit or compensation to you. Accuracy
    of Information. Geeker makes no representation or warranty about the
    accuracy or suitability of the User Submissions or other information
    displayed on the Platform or provided through Platform services. We use
    commercially reasonable efforts to promptly update any incorrect information
    displayed on the Platform, when we are notified or otherwise become aware of
    such inaccuracy. We do not have any obligation to contact you to update or
    correct any information previously accessed by or provided to you through
    the Platform or related services. Third-Party Intellectual Property Third
    Party Materials and Intellectual Property. The Platform may contain links to
    third party websites, advertisements, services, offers, activities or other
    content (collectively, "Third-Party Materials"), and Third-Party Materials
    may be provided on the Platform as part of the Platform services. These

    or any third party for any cost of cover, lost profits or direct, indirect,
    incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages whatsoever arising
    out of, based on, or resulting from your use of the Platform and your use
    of, or transactions with, Geeker, Consumers, Service Providers or other
    third parties, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, negligence or any
    other legal theory, whether or not such damages are foreseeable and whether
    or not Geeker is advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing
    limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law
    in the applicable jurisdiction. In no event will the collective liability of
    the Geeker Parties arising out of or in connection with the Terms, the
    Platform , and your use of, or transactions with, Geeker, Consumers, Service
    Providers or other third parties exceed the lesser of (a) the amount you
    have paid to Geeker for use of the Platform in the preceding 6-month period
    or (b) $250. Any claims relating to the Services or the Terms must be
    brought within one (1) year from the date the cause of action arose. Claims
    brought after such period will be VOID. Indemnification In addition to your
    indemnification obligations with respect to false or incorrect information
    (described above), you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
    Geeker Parties from and against any claims, disputes, demands, losses,
    obligations, liabilities, expenses, damages and costs (including attorneys’
    fees) due to or arising out of (2) your transactions with Consumers, Service
    Providers or other third parties, or (3) any violation by you of any of the
    Terms or applicable laws. Geeker reserves the right, at its own cost and
    sole discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
    otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully
    cooperate with Geeker in asserting any available defenses. Release You agree
    that you bear all risk and, in consideration of your access to and use of
    the Platofrm, you hereby release Geeker, its affiliates, and their
    respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, shareholders,
    agents, representatives, licensors, licensees and suppliers (collectively,
    the "Geeker Parties") from all claims, demands, liabilities and damages
    (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown,
    suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, now and in the future,
    arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the Platform and
    your use of, or transactions with, Geeker, Consumers, Service Providers or
    other third parties (including any claims under the federal Telephone
    Consumer Protection Act, Truth In Caller ID Act or Telemarketing Sales Rule
    and any state equivalents, and any federal or state tort or consumer
    protection laws). You further waive any and all rights and benefits
    otherwise conferred by any statutory or non-statutory law of any
    jurisdiction that would purport to limit the scope of a release or waiver.
    You waive and relinquish all rights and benefits which you have or may have
    under the statutory or non-statutory law of any jurisdiction relating to the
    release of claims, rights or benefits of which you may be unaware, to the
    full extent that you may lawfully waive all such claims, rights and
    benefits. Disputes Binding Arbitration. You agree that any dispute or claim
    arising out of or relating in any way to the Terms, your access to or use of
    any aspect of the Platform or any relationship between us, including the
    validity, applicability or interpretation of the Terms (any of these, a
    “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court.
    There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
    award is limited. The arbitration will be conducted by the American
    Arbitration Association (AAA) under its then-applicable rules, including (as
    appropriate) its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The
    AAA's rules are available at http://www.adr.org/. Payment of all filing,
    administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. The
    arbitration shall be conducted in the English language by a single
    independent and neutral arbitrator. For any hearing conducted in person as
    part of the arbitration, you agree that the hearing will be conducted in
    Westchester County, New York or the city within the United States in which
    you reside. Without limiting the jurisdiction of any other court, you admit
    and further irrevocably agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
    courts located within Westchester County, New York for the purpose of
    entering judgments on arbitral awards. Class Action Waiver. Any Dispute will
    be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or
    representative action or arbitration or as a named or unnamed member in a
    class, consolidated, representative or private attorney general legal
    action. Your access and continued use of the Properties and/or the Services
    signifies your explicit consent to this waiver. Venue. If for any reason a
    claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right
    to a jury trial and agree that such claim shall be brought only in courts of
    competent jurisdiction located in Westchester County, New York. You hereby
    submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waive any
    objection on the grounds of venue, forum non conveniens or any similar
    grounds with respect to any such proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the
    contrary, you and Geeker may seek injunctive relief and any other equitable
    remedies from any court of competent jurisdiction to protect intellectual
    property rights, whether in aid of, pending or independently of the
    resolution of any Dispute pursuant to the arbitration procedures set forth
    above. Governing Law. You agree that the Terms and any Dispute will be
    governed solely by United States and New York state law, without regard to
    conflict of law provisions. A Consumer’s rights under an agreement with a
    Service Provider will be governed by the terms of that agreement and by
    applicable federal, state, and local laws. Attorneys’ Fees. If any of the
    Geeker Parties take legal action against you as a result of your violation
    of these Terms, the GeekerParties will be entitled to recover from you, and
    you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of such action,
    in addition to any other relief granted to the Porch Parties. General
    Construction. All references to “dollars” or “$” in the Terms or on the
    Properties refer to United States dollars. Unless otherwise indicated, the
    words “include,” “includes” and “including,” when used in the Terms, shall
    be deemed in each case to be followed by the words “without limitation.”
    Assignment. The Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may be
    transferred or assigned by you only with Geeker's prior written consent, but
    may be assigned by Geeker without restriction and without notice to you.
    Entire Agreement and Severability. The Terms (which, as noted above, include
    any applicable Additional Program Terms) constitute the entire agreement
    between you and Geeker concerning the Services and supersede all prior or
    contemporaneous communications of any kind between you and Geeker with
    respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court
    or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or
    unenforceable, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum
    extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best embodies the
    intent of these Terms, and the remainder of these Terms shall remain in full
    force and effect. Waiver. No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be
    deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and
    Geeker's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall
    not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Third Party
    Beneficiaries. Nothing in the Terms create any right of action on the part
    of any third party, except (i) for the Geeker Parties and suppliers or
    others who are party to written agreements with us explicitly giving them
    third party beneficiary rights and (ii) as expressly provided in the
    applicable Additional Program Terms. Export Control. Software and the
    transmission of applicable technical data, if any, in connection with the
    Services may be subject to export controls. You agree to comply with all
    applicable laws regarding software and the transmission of technical data
    exported from the United States or the country in which you reside. Contact
